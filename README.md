# My Private Cloud Reference Design
Can we design and build a fully functioning Private Cloud Platform using a cluster of Raspberry PIâ€™s using current Cloud Technologies? I set out to answer this question.

This repository contains the design, code, and documentation for the My Private Cloud Reference Design, which is a project that implements a FULLY functioning Private Cloud using a cluster of Raspberry Pi 4's running on RaspbianOS, Docker, and Kubernetes that is all managed by a Port Application implmeneted using Spring Boot and Java 15.
